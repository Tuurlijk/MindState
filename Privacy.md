# Privacy Policy for MindState

**Effective Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

MindState ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use MindState, an Android application (the "App").

### 1. Information We Do NOT Collect
MindState is designed with your privacy as a top priority. The App **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data whatsoever**.

Specifically, MindState does **not**:
- Collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information
- Access or collect your location data
- Access your contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or any other sensors or files on your device
- Track your usage or behavior within the App
- Use analytics tools, crash reporting services, or advertising networks
- Send any data to our servers or any third-party servers
- Use cookies, device identifiers, advertising IDs, or any tracking technologies
- Require account creation or login

All data processed by MindState (if any) is generated and stored **exclusively on your device** and is never transmitted outside your phone.

### 2. Local Storage (On Your Device Only)
Any notes, settings, preferences, or information you create within MindState are saved **only locally on your device** using secure, private Android storage mechanisms. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not backed up to any cloud service by us
- Is only accessible by the MindState app on your device
- Will be deleted if you uninstall the app or clear app data

### 3. Permissions
MindState requests **no special permissions** from your device. It does not require internet access, storage permissions, or any other permissions that could potentially be used to collect data.

### 4. Third-Party Services
MindState does **not** integrate with or use any third-party services, SDKs, libraries, or frameworks that could collect data on our behalf.

### 5. Children's Privacy
MindState does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). Because we collect no data at all, the App is inherently compliant with COPPA and similar children's privacy regulations.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Since the App does not collect any data, you will not receive notifications of changes, but we encourage you to review this policy periodically.

### 7. Contact Us

Thank you for using MindState — an app that truly respects your privacy by collecting nothing.
